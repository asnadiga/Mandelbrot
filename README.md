##Installation
navigate to this location and run
    pip install -r requirements.txt

##Running the App
to start, run:
    python (or python3 or py or whatever) Application.py


##Controls
    zoom in - double click
    zoom out - right click
    pan - click,drag,release click
    
    When very zoom out the number of iterations needed to generate a decent image is low, the default number of iterations is 50.
    To sharpen the picture after zooming in, enter a higher value for Max Number of Iterations and click apply.
    Increasing Max Number of Iterations will decrease performance

##Things to come in the future
1. Comments in the code hopefully
2. Cleaning up of the code (removing the many unneeded print statements and such)
3. Ability to pick color scheme
4. Ability to save current view
